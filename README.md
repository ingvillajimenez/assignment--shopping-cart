#### Sprint 1 | Toggle the Shopping Cart

Show and hide the shopping cart. Pay attention to the classes that you need to make this.

#### Sprint 2 | Consume from [BestBuy](https://developer.bestbuy.com/)

Create an account and get an API KEY. We’ll be consuming only the **Products API**.

#### Sprint 3 | Add Products to the Shopping Cart

If you click on any of the products displayed, it should appear on the shopping cart. Read the structure to analyze what you need to send.

#### Sprint 4 | Get Total Price in Shopping Cart

Of course, how do I know how much money I need to pay? Create this feature.

#### Sprint 5 | Delete Products from Shopping Cart

Ups! I added the wrong product. Give me the ability to delete it from Shopping Cart.

#### Sprint 6 | BONUS | Validate Shopping Cart

What happend if you add twice the same product? It should appear just one time with **two** units.

#### Sprint 7 | BONUS | Increment units in Shopping Cart

I want to add 10 times this product, but I don’t want to click ten times the button **Add to cart**. Create the functionality using the `select`.
